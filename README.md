Vetogram
Application for Veterinary made in Django

While an account with admin permission can access all functions in the application, a user without permission cannot create, edit or delete any records. You must be logged into the application, except for the home page. If you want, you can create an account yourself.

There are models for Pet owners and patients in the application.
I used a class-based form because I thought it was simple to use on the frontend.
